Home: The SEP program was created to expose students into topics like processing, robotics, gathering and analyzing data,python, html and css. SEP is a class that takes all 4 years and is only for determined and creative students. The class will strengthen studentsâ€™ creativity, initiative, ability to cooperate with others, and will also learn how to snap their fingers

Students

What you will learn
9th grade
 Scratch: A platform used to make processing seem simpler. The platform replaces code for blocks and does not show you the true power of processing. Here you will make games and will learn the fundamental building blocks and use them later on.

Robotics: Using the EV3 software, you will write code that will control a robot in the real world. This lesson will make you realize the stuff that software can do.

Python: A simple software language used to show beginners what coding will be and how it may look like.The important syntax that this language requires makes students learn the importance of it in other languages.

10th Grade
Processing: In this grade you will learn p5js to create games. This language is more advanced than anything in 9th grade. P5js is a mix of JS and aims at being an easy language to use when creating a visual project.

Makey Makey/Arduino:
Using code and real life circuits to make LEDs blink in certain patterns. 
Data:
Lesson that focuses on gathering data and using the same data to make predictions. Learn how to make formulas making gathering data easy and also learn how they are important.

11th Grade
 
Github: 
A program from the github.com webpage. Used to organize and make saves and edits much easier not only for independent project but also for collaborations. Makes working on projects and also previewing it easier as well. 

Web Design:
 Re-learning the basics of HTML and CSS to later explore deeper into them. You would then also learn about bootstrap and how it is important to have a responsive website.
3D Modeling:
In this unit, students will be able to create anything they want with a program, printing it out as a three dimensional model.


12
Ruby
Ruby is a programing language that is widely used in websites. Its a language that gives control of back-end parts of websites. It is also used in many other languages.

Sinatra
Sinatra is a program that is written in Ruby. A simple language that will teach students how smart phone applications work and how to create one.                      

Independent Study
In this final lesson of SEP, students will have the option of choosing what to learn on a timeline. After researching and learning on their own, they will show the class what they have learned.
